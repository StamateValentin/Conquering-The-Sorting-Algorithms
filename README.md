<img width="1000" src="https://i.postimg.cc/BQSGrMtD/Capture.png">

An easy way for visualizing popular sorting algorithms. The UI is very intuitive and you can switch very easily between then.

## About

The project is write in Java 8.
If you wonder how I was able to visualize an algorithm witch is using recursive calls, I used the `thread` concept.

Sorting Algorithms :
```
• Selection Sort
• Bubble Sort
• Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Radix Sort
* Pigeonhole Sort
* Heap Sort
```
