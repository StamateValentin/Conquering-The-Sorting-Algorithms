<img width="600" src="https://i.postimg.cc/B62whM2v/Capture.png">

An easy way for visualizing popular sorting algorithms. The UI is very intuitive and you can swich very easily between then.

## About

The project is write in Java 8.
If you wonder how I was able to visualize an algorithm wich is using recursive calls, I used the `thread` concept.

This include:

* `Selection Sort`

## How To Run

In order to run this, you'll need to install [Processing](https://processing.org/) first. Open Sketch.pde under Sketch folder and you are done.

## Built With

* [Processing](https://processing.org/) - The software for visualizing sorting algorithms
