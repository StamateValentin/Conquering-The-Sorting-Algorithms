<img width="600" src="https://i.postimg.cc/MKgp1sgX/Capture.png">

An easy way for visualizing popular sorting algorithms. The UI is very intuitive and you can swich very easily between then.

## About

The project is write in Java 8.
If you wonder how I was able to visualize an algorithm wich is using recursive calls, I used the `thread` concept.

Sorting Algorithms :
```
• Selection Sort
• Bubble Sort
• Quick Sort
```
## How To Run

### Must Have :

* [Processing](https://processing.org/)
* [ControlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/)

To run it, open Sketch.pde under Sketch folder.

## Built With

* [Processing](https://processing.org/) - The software for visualizing sorting algorithms
